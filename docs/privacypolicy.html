            <li>To diagnose and resolve technical issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal data to third parties. However, we may share your information:</p>

            <li><strong>As required by law:</strong> To comply with legal obligations, respond to legal processes, or enforce our terms and policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We are committed to protecting your data. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to secure your information. However, please note that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
